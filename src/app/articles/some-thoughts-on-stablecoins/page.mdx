Alright, hear me out. SaaS companies should probably start thinking about ditching credit cards and moving to stablecoin payments. Not today, not next quarter, but soon-ish. Because credit cards are a scam. Okay, maybe not a scam, but a wildly outdated and stupidly expensive tax on software businesses.

```solidity
// No banks. No middlemen.

pragma solidity ^0.8.19;

interface ERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address, address, uint256) external returns (bool);
}

contract Trustless {
    ERC20 public usdc;
    address public owner;

    constructor(address _usdc) {
        owner = msg.sender;
        usdc = ERC20(_usdc);
    }

    function pay(uint256 amount) external {
        require(usdc.transferFrom(msg.sender, owner, amount), "Payment failed.");
    }
}
```

Think about it: every time someone pays you, **2.9% + $0.30** disappears into the pockets of banks and payment processors. On a $100 subscription? That’s $3 gone. Multiply that by thousands, and suddenly you’re just working for Visa and Stripe. And that’s before you deal with **failed payments, chargebacks, disputes, fraud.** Fun times.

Enter stablecoins. **USDC, PYUSD, whatever comes next.** They settle instantly, cost basically nothing to move, and don’t do the whole "Oops! Your payment is pending for 3-5 business days" thing. It’s just… better money infrastructure. Imagine SaaS revenue that moves in real-time. Imagine subscriptions that can’t fail because a bank randomly flagged a customer’s payment as suspicious.

But yeah, I know, I know—**nobody has wallets.** That’s the problem. Right now, telling your customers to pay in stablecoins is like asking them to fax you a check. The UX for crypto payments is still hot garbage. Most people aren’t set up to send USDC, and asking them to do so is a great way to lose customers.

So, what’s the move? **First, start watching the space.** PayPal’s already on this with PYUSD. Stripe just acquired Bridge, which sure looks like a “let’s figure out how to integrate stablecoins into payments” play. Big players are setting up the rails, and the moment they make it easy for normies, the floodgates open.

**Second, start experimenting.** Maybe it’s offering stablecoin payments for international customers to avoid FX fees. Maybe it’s giving enterprise customers a “pay in USDC, save 2%” option. Maybe it’s just holding some revenue in stablecoins instead of letting banks sit on your money. The point is: start somewhere.

Because in a few years, SaaS companies that are still paying 3% to process payments will look like e-commerce brands that refused to offer free shipping. Stablecoins aren’t here **yet** for mass adoption—but when they are, you don’t want to be the last one standing in the credit card graveyard.
